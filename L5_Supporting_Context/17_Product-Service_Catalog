# Product/service catalog

## What this generates

Your comprehensive product/service catalog and market intelligence package using Jobs-To-Be-Done framework, Feature/Benefit/Proof structure, Porter's Five Forces, Gartner Hype Cycle, Technology Adoption Life Cycle (TALC), and PESTEL analysis. You'll get detailed product profiles with JTBD statements, feature/benefit/proof architecture, pricing structure, use case matrix, integration profiles, competitive landscape analysis, market maturity assessment, macro-environmental analysis, and strategic insights including industry trends, regulatory requirements, terminology glossary, and myths to address.

## Why you need this

You can't sell effectively if your team doesn't understand what jobs customers are hiring your product to do, how features translate to tangible benefits, or what proof backs up your claims. And you can't position strategically without understanding competitive forces, market maturity, and macro trends shaping buyer behavior. This framework creates both the product knowledge foundation your team needs and the strategic market intelligence that informs positioning and messaging.

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you have:
- Detailed product/service specifications and capabilities
- Customer outcome data, metrics, or case study results
- Clear understanding of use cases across different personas and industries
- Pricing structure with tier differentiation
- Competitive intelligence and market positioning clarity
- Knowledge of regulatory requirements and compliance standards

If you're early-stage, you can build this based on product roadmap, customer discovery insights, and strategic hypotheses about market positioning. Just be clear about what's validated vs. aspirational.

**Pro tip:** For customer outcomes and proof points, include specific numbers with context. "Customers see 30% improvement" is weak. "Enterprise customers reduced sales cycle from 90 to 63 days (30% improvement) within first quarter of implementation" is powerful.

You are a strategic product marketing expert. Your task is to create a detailed product/service catalog that articulates value through customer jobs-to-be-done, connects features to tangible benefits with proof, and provides strategic market context for effective positioning and messaging.

## Part 1: Product/service catalog (JTBD + Feature/Benefit/Proof)

For each product or service, create:

### Jobs-to-be-done statement
- Identify the functional, emotional, and social jobs the customer is hiring this product to accomplish
- Frame from the customer's perspective: "When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]"

### Feature → Benefit → Proof structure
- **Features:** Core capabilities and specifications
- **Benefits:** Tangible outcomes and value delivered (connect features to customer results)
- **Proof points:** Quantifiable evidence, metrics, case study results, testimonials, certifications, or third-party validation

### Pricing architecture
- Tier structure with feature differentiation
- Value justification for each tier
- Typical customer profile per tier

### Use case matrix
- Primary use cases mapped to personas
- Industry-specific applications
- Workflow integration scenarios

### Integration & compatibility profile
- Technical requirements
- Platform compatibility
- Key integrations available
- Implementation considerations

## Part 2: Industry & market context analysis

Provide strategic market intelligence using multiple analytical frameworks:

### A. Competitive landscape (Porter's Five Forces)
- **Threat of new entrants:** Barriers to entry, capital requirements, switching costs
- **Bargaining power of suppliers:** Dependency, concentration, differentiation
- **Bargaining power of buyers:** Price sensitivity, volume, alternatives
- **Threat of substitutes:** Alternative solutions, value-price trade-offs
- **Competitive rivalry:** Market concentration, growth rate, differentiation

### B. Market maturity assessment (Gartner Hype Cycle + TALC)
- **Hype Cycle position:** Where does this product category sit? (Innovation Trigger → Peak of Inflated Expectations → Trough of Disillusionment → Slope of Enlightenment → Plateau of Productivity)
- **Adoption segment:** Primary target (Innovators/Early Adopters/Early Majority/Late Majority/Laggards)
- **Implications:** Go-to-market and messaging strategy based on maturity

### C. Macro-environmental analysis (PESTEL)
- **Political:** Regulatory landscape, government policies, trade restrictions
- **Economic:** Market conditions, economic indicators, funding environment
- **Sociocultural:** Demographic trends, cultural shifts, workforce changes
- **Technological:** Innovation pace, infrastructure, emerging technologies
- **Environmental:** Sustainability requirements, climate considerations
- **Legal:** Compliance requirements, intellectual property, data privacy

### D. Strategic insights compilation
- **Key industry trends:** Top 3-5 trends with implications for the business
- **Regulatory & compliance requirements:** Must-know standards, certifications, legal considerations
- **Industry terminology glossary:** 15-20 essential terms for consistent communication
- **Myths & misconceptions:** Common misunderstandings that need addressing in messaging

## Output format

Deliver the following structured documents:

### 1. Product catalog master document
- Executive summary
- Individual product/service profiles (JTBD + Feature/Benefit/Proof)
- Pricing comparison chart
- Use case matrix
- Integration guide

### 2. Market intelligence brief
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Market maturity assessment

## After you run it

Turn this into your product knowledge system:
- **Train every customer-facing team** (sales, CS, product marketing) on the JTBD framework and feature/benefit/proof structure
- **Build sales enablement assets** - battlecards, one-pagers, comparison charts based on the catalog
- **Create pricing justification** materials that connect tier value to customer profiles
- **Develop use case libraries** organized by persona and industry
- **Update your website** to lead with jobs-to-be-done and benefits, not feature lists
- **Brief your content team** on industry trends, terminology, and myths to address

Use the market intelligence to inform strategy:
- **Align product roadmap** to Porter's Five Forces insights (e.g., if threat of substitutes is high, invest in differentiation)
- **Tailor messaging** based on Hype Cycle position (early adopters need different language than mainstream buyers)
- **Build thought leadership** around the trends and myths you've identified
- **Track regulatory changes** and update compliance positioning as requirements evolve

Refresh this quarterly or when major product launches, competitive shifts, or market changes occur. Your product catalog should be a living document that evolves with your business.
