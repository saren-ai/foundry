# Industry context

## What this generates

Your comprehensive industry context analysis using Porter's Five Forces framework (to analyze competitive market structure) and Gartner's Hype Cycle (to assess technology adoption maturity). You'll get market landscape overview, technology adoption maturity assessment, key trends with implications, regulatory and compliance landscape, industry-specific terminology guide, common myths and misconceptions analysis, and strategic recommendations for messaging.

## Why you need this

You can't build credible positioning or messaging without understanding the strategic forces shaping your market. Are barriers to entry high or low? Is your category hyped or mature? What regulations create moats? What myths do prospects believe that hold them back? This analysis gives you the industry intelligence to position strategically, speak with authority, and anticipate market shifts before they happen.

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you have:
- Clear understanding of the major trends shaping your industry (technology, regulation, buyer behavior)
- Knowledge of regulatory requirements that impact your buyers or your business
- Awareness of common misconceptions prospects have about your problem space
- Familiarity with industry-specific terminology and jargon that signals expertise

If you're entering a new market, lean on analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester), industry publications, competitive research, and customer discovery interviews to fill in gaps.

## Prepare your inputs

Fill out this form before running the prompt. The more specific and detailed your inputs, the more strategic and actionable your analysis will be.

### Market & industry basics

**{{icpIndustries}}**  
What industry or vertical market does your company operate in? Be as specific as possible.  
Examples: "Enterprise SaaS for financial services compliance," "Healthcare technology for remote patient monitoring," "Sales enablement software for B2B mid-market," "API infrastructure for fintech"

**{{companyStage}}**  
Where is your company in its lifecycle? This helps contextualize competitive positioning within market forces.  
Options: Startup (pre-Series A), Growth stage (Series A-C), Established (profitable, scaling), Mature (market leader, stable)

### Market dynamics

**{{industryTrends}}**  
What are the 3-5 most significant trends currently driving change in your industry? Consider technological shifts, buyer behavior changes, economic factors, competitive dynamics.  
Examples:  
- "Remote work forcing shift from in-office to distributed sales team workflows"

What specialized terminology, jargon, acronyms, or insider language is used in your industry? Include technical terms, industry buzzwords, terms that signal expertise, and phrases to avoid.  
Examples:  
- "Sales velocity, win rate, sales cycle length (insider terms buyers use)"  
- "Revenue operations, RevOps (emerging terminology that signals sophistication)"  
- "CRM, ACV, ARR, MRR, NDR (acronyms that need no explanation in our space)"  
- "Avoid: 'game-changing,' 'revolutionary,' 'world-class' (generic marketing speak)"

**{{commonMisconceptions}}**  
What are the most common myths, misconceptions, or mistaken beliefs your prospects have about the problem space, solutions, or your category?  
Examples:  
- "Myth: 'Sales enablement is just a content library.' Reality: It's about behavior change and rep consistency"

You are a strategic marketing analyst tasked with creating a comprehensive industry context analysis for a client. This analysis will serve as foundational input for all subsequent messaging, positioning, and go-to-market strategies.

## Your task

Using Porter's Five Forces framework (to analyze competitive market structure) and Gartner's Hype Cycle (to assess technology adoption maturity), create a detailed industry context document that provides strategic clarity on the market landscape.

## Analysis framework

### 1. Market landscape overview (Porter's Five Forces)

Analyze and document:
- **Competitive rivalry:** Current competitive intensity, key players, market share distribution, differentiation factors
- **Threat of new entrants:** Barriers to entry, capital requirements, regulatory hurdles, brand loyalty factors
- **Bargaining power of suppliers:** Supplier concentration, switching costs, input criticality
- **Bargaining power of buyers:** Customer concentration, price sensitivity, switching costs, information availability
- **Threat of substitutes:** Alternative solutions, price-performance trade-offs, switching ease

Synthesize these five forces into a clear assessment of industry attractiveness and profitability potential.

### 2. Technology adoption maturity (Gartner Hype Cycle)

Position the industry/solution within the Hype Cycle:
- **Innovation Trigger:** Early proof-of-concept, no usable products yet
- **Peak of Inflated Expectations:** Early publicity, some success stories, many failures
- **Trough of Disillusionment:** Interest wanes, implementations fail, shakeout begins
- **Slope of Enlightenment:** Benefits become clearer, second/third generation products emerge
- **Plateau of Productivity:** Mainstream adoption, clear ROI, market stability

Provide implications for messaging strategy based on current position.

### 3. Key trends & their implications

For each major trend identified, analyze:
- **Trend description:** What's changing and why
- **Driving forces:** Technology, regulation, customer behavior, economic factors
- **Timeline:** Short-term (0-12 months), medium-term (1-3 years), long-term (3+ years)
- **Strategic implications:** How this affects positioning, messaging, and competitive advantage
- **Opportunity vs. threat assessment:** Where to lean in or defend

### 4. Regulatory & compliance landscape

Document all relevant regulations:
- Regulation name and governing body
- Applicability criteria: Who must comply and when
- Key requirements: What compliance entails
- Penalties for non-compliance: Risks and consequences
- Competitive advantage opportunities: How compliance can be positioned as a differentiator
- Messaging considerations: What can/cannot be claimed

### 5. Industry-specific terminology

Create a comprehensive terminology guide:
- **Insider terms:** Jargon that signals credibility and expertise
- **Technical definitions:** Precise meanings of key concepts
- **Acronyms and abbreviations:** Full forms and usage context
- **Terms to avoid:** Outdated language, competitors' proprietary terms
- **Preferred language:** How sophisticated buyers talk about problems/solutions

### 6. Common myths & misconceptions

For each misconception:
- **The myth:** What prospects incorrectly believe
- **Why it persists:** Source of the misconception
- **The reality:** What's actually true
- **Evidence/proof points:** Data, studies, examples that debunk the myth
- **Messaging strategy:** How to educate without condescending
- **Objection handling:** Pre-emptive positioning to overcome this barrier

## Output format

Deliver your analysis as a structured document with:
1. Executive summary (2-3 paragraphs synthesizing key findings)
2. Market structure analysis (Porter's Five Forces breakdown)
3. Adoption maturity assessment (Hype Cycle positioning with visual description if possible)
4. Trend analysis (3-5 key trends with full implications)
5. Regulatory landscape (Compliance requirements matrix)
6. Language guide (Do's and don'ts terminology table)
7. Myths to address (Misconceptions with counter-positioning)
8. Strategic recommendations (3-5 high-level implications for messaging strategy)

## Quality standards

- Use specific industry data and examples, not generic platitudes
- Cite authoritative sources where possible (industry reports, analyst firms, regulatory bodies)
- Provide actionable implications, not just descriptions
- Flag areas where additional client input would strengthen the analysis
- Maintain strategic perspective—this informs positioning, not just education

## After you run it

Use this analysis to inform everything else:
- **Brief your team** on industry forces shaping your strategy—sales, marketing, product
- **Build thought leadership** content around the trends and myths you've identified
- **Update positioning** to lean into favorable market forces (e.g., if barriers to entry are high, emphasize your incumbency)
- **Create objection handling** scripts based on the myths and misconceptions analysis
- **Audit your language** against the terminology guide—are you speaking like an insider or an outsider?
- **Track regulatory changes** and update messaging when new requirements create opportunities

Share this with every new hire, agency, or consultant who touches your messaging. It's the shared context that prevents generic, off-target communications.

Update this annually or when major market shifts occur—new regulations, category maturity changes, competitive shakeouts, or technology breakthroughs that reposition your value.
