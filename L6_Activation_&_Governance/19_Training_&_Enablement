# Training & enablement materials

## What this generates

Your comprehensive training and enablement framework using Adult Learning Theory (Malcolm Knowles), the 70-20-10 Learning Model, Bloom's Taxonomy, and the ADDIE Model. You'll get onboarding curriculum, six core training modules, role-specific training guides, three-tier certification framework, self-assessment tools, practice scenarios and simulations, refresher training modules, ongoing enablement calendar, measurement framework, and implementation roadmap. This ensures knowledge retention, practical application, and measurable competency.

## Why you need this

Inconsistent onboarding and ad-hoc training create teams that don't speak the same brand language, make the same mistakes repeatedly, and can't scale without constant supervision. A systematic enablement program turns tribal knowledge into transferable competency, reduces time-to-productivity for new hires, and creates a culture of continuous learning. This is how you scale expertise, not just headcount.

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you have:
- Clear patterns in recurring mistakes or knowledge gaps your team encounters
- Understanding of your current onboarding process and what's working vs. not
- Sense of who will own ongoing enablement and what capacity they have
- Knowledge of available training tools and delivery preferences
- All 16 foundational brand artifacts completed (these become training content)

If you're early-stage with a small team, you can still build this as a scalable framework to implement as you grow. Just be realistic about what you can execute now vs. later.

## Prepare your inputs

Fill out this form before running the prompt. The more specific your context and examples, the more practical and implementable your training program will be.

### Team & organizational context

**{{teamRoles}}**  
Describe your current team structure, size, and key roles.  
Example: "15-person team: 5 AEs (sales), 3 SDRs, 4 marketing (1 content, 1 demand gen, 1 product marketing, 1 ops), 2 customer success managers, 1 sales engineer"

**{{onboardingProcess}}**  
Describe your current onboarding approach, duration, and what's working/not working.  
Examples:  
- "2-week informal buddy system where new hires shadow different team members. No structured curriculum. Works: People get to know the team quickly. Doesn't work: Inconsistent knowledge transfer, reps take 6 months to ramp"  
- "We have a 30-day checklist but it's just admin tasks (benefits, tools setup). No training on brand, messaging, or methodology"

**{{onboardingTimeline}}**  
Specify your ideal onboarding duration and any constraints.  
Examples: "30-day intensive program with weekly milestones," "90-day gradual integration with monthly check-ins," "2-week crash course due to fast hiring pace"

### Performance & gaps

**{{commonMistakes}}**  
List the top 3-5 recurring errors, knowledge gaps, or performance issues your team encounters.  
Examples:  
- "Sales reps use generic value props instead of our messaging pillars"  
- "Inconsistent product positioning—everyone describes us differently"  
- "Customer success team doesn't know how to handle competitive objections"  
- "Marketing creates content off-brand because they don't understand our voice guidelines"  
- "New hires take 90 days to learn our qualification methodology"

### Delivery & ownership

**{{trainingPreference}}**  
Specify your preferred delivery method(s).  
Examples:  
- "Hybrid: 30% live virtual sessions, 70% self-paced asynchronous"  
- "100% in-person workshops during quarterly team gatherings"  
- "Fully remote and asynchronous—team is distributed globally"  
- "Live sessions for onboarding, self-paced for ongoing enablement"

**{{enablementOwner}}**  
Identify who will own ongoing training and enablement. Include their capacity/bandwidth.  
Examples:  
- "VP Sales, 5 hours/month available—needs turnkey materials"  
- "Dedicated Enablement Manager starting next quarter—can build custom content"  
- "Founder for now, will hire enablement lead at 25 employees"  
- "Marketing Manager + Sales Manager co-own, 10 hours/month combined"

**{{toolsAvailable}}**  
List learning/training tools and platforms you currently use or have access to.  
Examples:  
- "Zoom, Google Workspace, no LMS currently—need simple solutions"  
- "Articulate 360 for course creation, Docebo LMS, Gong for call reviews"  
- "Notion for documentation, Loom for video walkthroughs, no formal LMS"  
- "We can invest in tools if needed—budget for LMS if recommended"

### Optional but helpful

**{{productDescription}}**  
Brief description of what you do, who you serve, and key differentiators. Reference your Brand Positioning Statement if you've already created it.

**{{trainingPriorities}}**  
Any urgent skills gaps or upcoming launches requiring accelerated enablement.  
Example: "New product launching in Q2—need sales team trained on positioning in 6 weeks"

**{{kpis}}**  
How you currently measure team readiness or performance (if applicable).  
Example: "Track time-to-first-deal for new reps, win rate by rep, customer onboarding completion rates"

**Pro tip:** The "common mistakes" section is gold—it reveals exactly where training should focus and what scenarios to build practice exercises around. Don't generalize. Pull real examples from recent performance reviews or deal losses.

You are an expert instructional designer and organizational learning strategist. Using Adult Learning Theory (Malcolm Knowles), the 70-20-10 Learning Model, Bloom's Taxonomy, and the ADDIE Model, create comprehensive training and enablement materials that ensure knowledge retention, practical application, and measurable competency.

## Framework application

- **Adult Learning Theory:** Design all materials to be self-directed, experience-based, and problem-focused, respecting that adult learners bring valuable experience and need immediate relevance
- **70-20-10 Model:** Structure learning so 70% happens through on-the-job experiences, 20% through coaching and peer learning, and 10% through formal training sessions
- **Bloom's Taxonomy:** Progress learning objectives from foundational knowledge → comprehension → application → analysis → evaluation → creation, ensuring learners can apply concepts in real business situations
- **ADDIE Model:** Follow Analysis → Design → Development → Implementation → Evaluation to create systematic, continuously improving training programs
