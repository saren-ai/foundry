# Brand guidelines master document

## What this generates

Your comprehensive Brand Guidelines Master Document using Modular Brand Architecture Framework and Living Brand Guideline principles. You'll get three versions: Internal (40-60 pages with complete positioning, messaging, voice, visual identity, and governance), External (25-35 pages for partners with essential brand elements), and Quick-Reference (8-12 pages for at-a-glance guidance). This compiles all 16 foundational artifacts into one cohesive, actionable source of truth.

## Why you need this

Without a master brand guidelines document, your team has scattered knowledge in 16 different docs that nobody reads or follows consistently. Sales uses off-brand language. Design creates logo variations that violate standards. Partners butcher your messaging. A comprehensive, well-organized guideline document turns your brand foundation into an operational system—one place where everyone can find the answer to "how should this look, sound, or be positioned?"

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you've already completed the 16 foundational artifacts:
1. Target Customer Profiles
2. Market & Competitive Analysis  
3. Mission, Vision, Values & Brand Narrative
4. Brand Voice & Tone
5. Brand Personality & Archetype
6. Unique Value Propositions
7. Brand Positioning Statement
8. Brand Promise
9. Core Messaging Pillars
10. Message Map
11. Elevator Pitch & Boilerplate
12. Example Communications
13. Taglines & Slogans
14. Sales Methodology
15. Industry Context
16. Product/Service Catalog

You'll also need visual identity assets (logo, colors, typography) to include in the guidelines. If you don't have these yet, you can build the strategic/messaging sections now and add visual identity later.

## Prepare your inputs

Fill out this form before running the prompt. This is essentially gathering everything you've created so far.

- Typography choices (font names, weights, usage rules)
- Photography style examples or guidelines
- Iconography system (if you have one)
- Any existing design standards or templates

If you don't have all visual assets finalized, note what you have and what's in development.

### Organizational context

**{{accessPermissions}}**  
Define who should have access to which versions of the guidelines.

Examples:
- **Internal full access:** All marketing, sales, product, and customer success teams
- **External version:** Agency partners, freelance designers, co-marketing partners
- **Quick-reference:** Everyone in the company, especially those who don't touch brand daily (engineering, finance, legal)

**{{existingTemplates}}**  
Any current templates you want incorporated or referenced.

Examples: PowerPoint template, Word letterhead, Email signature format, Social media post templates, Sales one-pager template, Case study template

**{{consistencyChallenges}}**  
Known pain points or areas where brand guidelines have been inconsistently applied in the past.

Examples:

- "Regional offices use old logo versions"
- "Social media tone varies wildly by channel"
- "Partners create co-branded materials that violate our visual standards"
- "Product team launches features without checking brand positioning"

**Pro tip:** The "consistency challenges" section is critical—it tells the LLM where to add extra emphasis, examples, and guardrails in the guidelines. Don't skip this.
