# Target customer profiles

## What this generates

3-5 detailed buyer personas that combine company-level characteristics (ICP) with individual motivations, behaviors, and decision-making patterns. This is the foundation for everything else—messaging, content strategy, sales enablement, and segmentation.

## Why you need this

You can't write compelling copy, build effective campaigns, or train your sales team without knowing exactly who you're talking to. Generic "mid-market CTO" descriptions don't cut it. These personas force you to get specific about the humans behind the job titles.

## Before you start

Gather whatever customer intelligence you have:
- Sales call notes or recordings
- Customer interviews or survey data  
- Win/loss analysis
- Support tickets that reveal pain points
- LinkedIn profiles of your best customers
- Competitive intel on who your rivals are targeting

I have created a Claude Artifact Survey to collect this data from my clients. [Check it out](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/1cc968a7-f72a-4401-860b-e77eb49df75f)

The better your inputs, the sharper your personas. If you're pre-revenue, lean on founder insights, industry research, and interviews with people who match your target profile.

## The prompt

Copy everything below this line and paste it into your LLM. Fill in your specific context where indicated.

You are an expert marketing strategist specializing in customer research and persona development. Your task is to create comprehensive Target Customer Profiles using the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) + Buyer Persona framework.

## Your objective

Develop 3-5 detailed buyer personas that combine firmographic/demographic data (ICP level) with deep psychographic insights (persona level). Each persona should provide actionable intelligence for messaging, sales, and content strategies.

## Framework approach

**ICP layer:** Broader organizational and demographic characteristics that define the target market

**Persona layer:** Individual motivations, behaviors, pain points, and decision-making patterns within that ICP

## Required output for each persona

Create a structured profile containing:

### 1. Persona overview
- Persona name (e.g., "Strategic Sarah - VP of Operations")
- Primary role/title
- Department/function
- Seniority level

### 2. Demographics & firmographics (ICP layer)
- Company size (employees/revenue)
- Industry/vertical
- Geographic location
- Technology stack/maturity level
- Annual budget authority

### 3. Professional context
- Day-to-day responsibilities
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) they're measured on
- Reporting structure (who they report to, who reports to them)
- Career aspirations

### 4. Pain points & challenges
- Top 3-5 business problems they face
- Personal frustrations in their role
- Consequences of not solving these problems
- Current workarounds or inadequate solutions

### 5. Goals & motivations
- Primary business objectives
- Personal success metrics
- What "winning" looks like for them
- Career advancement motivations

### 6. Buying behavior
- Typical buying triggers (what prompts them to seek solutions)
- Information gathering preferences (search, peer recommendations, analyst reports, etc.)
- Content consumption habits (formats, channels, topics)
- Decision-making criteria and priorities

### 7. Objections & barriers
- Common objections to purchasing solutions like yours
- Risk concerns (financial, operational, career)
- Competitive alternatives they consider
- Internal barriers (budget, approval, change resistance)

### 8. Decision process
- Role in the buying committee (champion, influencer, decision-maker, gatekeeper, end-user)
- Other stakeholders involved in the decision
- Typical evaluation timeline
- Approval requirements and budget cycles

### 9. Buying journey stages

Map their needs and behaviors across:
- **Early exploration:** Symptoms, trigger events, initial research
- **Evaluation:** Solution comparison, vendor assessment, stakeholder alignment
- **Decision:** Final criteria, negotiation points, implementation concerns

### 10. Messaging & engagement recommendations
- Key value propositions that resonate
- Recommended messaging tone and style
- Preferred communication channels
- Content types by journey stage
- Ideal touchpoint cadence

## Quality standards

- Base personas on real customer patterns from the provided inputs
- Avoid generic descriptions; be specific and actionable
- Include direct quotes or language patterns where possible
- Highlight differences between personas to guide segmentation
- Ensure each persona has clear implications for GTM strategy

## Context about our company

[Paste your company description, product/service details, and any relevant market positioning here]

## Customer intelligence inputs

[Paste any research, interview notes, sales insights, or customer data you have here]

## Specific instructions

[Add any additional requirements: number of personas, priority segments, industries to focus on, etc.]
```

## After you run it

Review the output for BS. If a persona feels like it could describe anyone, push back and ask for more specificity. Real personas should feel like you could pick them out of a LinkedIn search.

Use these to:
- Brief your copywriter or content team
- Build sales talk tracks and battlecards
- Prioritize product roadmap items
- Segment your email list or ad targeting
- Align your entire team on who you're actually selling to
