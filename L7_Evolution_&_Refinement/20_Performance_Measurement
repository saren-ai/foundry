# Performance measurement framework

## What this generates

Your comprehensive performance measurement framework using OKRs, Marketing Mix Modeling, Brand Health Tracking, Balanced Scorecards, and Multi-Touch Attribution. You'll get strategic OKRs aligned with business goals, brand health scorecard, message effectiveness metrics, channel performance KPIs, leading vs. lagging indicators map, three-tiered dashboard structure (executive, management, specialist), reporting cadence calendar, and continuous improvement process. This connects marketing activities to business outcomes and enables data-driven decision-making.

## Why you need this

"We're doing marketing but we don't know what's working" is the death of a marketing budget. Without a measurement framework, you're flying blind—unable to prove ROI, optimize spend, or make strategic decisions. Tracking vanity metrics (followers, impressions) instead of business outcomes (pipeline, revenue, brand equity) means you can't answer the CEO's question: "What are we getting for this investment?" This framework balances short-term tactical metrics with long-term brand building, so you can both prove impact today and build sustainable competitive advantage.

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you have:
- Clear business goals and growth targets for the next 12-24 months
- Current metrics you're tracking (even if imperfect) with baseline performance data
- Understanding of your biggest measurement blind spots—where you lack visibility
- Inventory of analytics tools, CRM, and data sources you have access to
- Clarity on who needs reports and how often they need them

If you're early-stage, you can build this based on strategic priorities and available tools, even if you're not tracking much yet. The framework will guide what to implement first.

## Prepare your inputs

Fill out this form before running the prompt. The more specific your goals and context, the more actionable your measurement framework will be.

### Business context

**{{businessGoals}}**  
What are your primary business objectives and specific growth targets for the next 12-24 months?  
Examples:  
- "Increase revenue from $5M to $10M ARR, expand from mid-market to enterprise segment, launch 2 new products, achieve 95% gross retention rate"  
- "Double pipeline from $20M to $40M, reduce CAC by 20%, increase average deal size from $50K to $75K, enter European market"

**{{currentMetrics}}**  
What metrics are you currently tracking, and what are your baseline performance levels?  
Examples:  
- "Monthly website visitors: 50K, MQL to SQL conversion: 18%, Average sales cycle: 90 days, Customer acquisition cost: $8,500, NPS: 42, Email open rate: 24%, LinkedIn engagement rate: 2.3%"  
- "We track basic Google Analytics (traffic, conversions) and Salesforce pipeline metrics, but don't have sophisticated attribution or brand health tracking"

**{{blindSpots}}**  
Where do you currently lack visibility or insights in your marketing performance?  
Examples:  
- "Don't know which marketing channels drive highest quality pipeline—just track first-touch attribution"  
- "No visibility into brand perception vs. competitors—we're guessing about positioning effectiveness"  
- "Can't connect marketing spend to revenue—sales says 'most deals come from referrals' but we can't prove it"  
- "Don't know if our messaging is resonating—just measuring vanity metrics like impressions"

### Operational context

**{{toolsAvailable}}**  
What analytics platforms, CRM systems, marketing automation tools, and data sources do you currently use?  
Examples:  
- "Google Analytics 4, HubSpot (CRM + marketing automation), Salesforce, LinkedIn Campaign Manager, Google Ads, SEMrush, no BI tool yet"  
- "Basic tech stack: Google Analytics, Mailchimp, social platform native analytics. Budget for one new tool if needed"  
- "Enterprise stack: Salesforce + Marketo + Tableau + 6sense + Gong + full martech suite"

**{{teamStructure}}**  
Who are the team members involved in measurement and reporting, and what are their roles?  
Examples:  
- "Marketing Director (owns strategy), Digital Marketing Manager (runs campaigns), Content Lead (creates content), no dedicated analyst—Director handles reporting"  
- "VP Marketing, Demand Gen Manager, Content Marketing Manager, Marketing Ops Analyst (part-time), Sales Ops Manager (partner for attribution)"

**{{reportingAudience}}**  
Who are the key stakeholders who will consume these reports, and what do they care about?  
Examples:  
- "CEO (cares about pipeline and ROI), CFO (cares about budget efficiency), VP Sales (cares about lead quality and velocity), Board (cares about brand health and market position quarterly)"  
- "Just founder + small team for now—need simple dashboards we can all understand"

**{{reportingCadence}}**  
What is your desired cadence for different types of reporting?  
Examples:  
- "Daily campaign snapshots for active campaigns, weekly channel performance review with marketing team, monthly comprehensive review with CEO, quarterly board presentation"  
- "Weekly dashboard check-ins, monthly deep dives, quarterly strategic reviews—keep it simple for now"

**Pro tip:** For "biggest blind spots," be brutally honest. "We have no idea if our $50K/month in LinkedIn ads is actually driving pipeline" is more useful than "we'd like better attribution." Specificity helps the LLM design measurements that actually solve your problems.

You are a performance measurement and marketing analytics expert specializing in OKRs, Marketing Mix Modeling, Brand Health Tracking, Balanced Scorecards, and Multi-Touch Attribution. Your task is to create a comprehensive Performance Measurement Framework that connects marketing activities to business outcomes and enables data-driven decision-making.

## Context

Using the provided client information, develop a measurement framework that:
- Aligns marketing performance with strategic business objectives
- Balances short-term tactical metrics with long-term brand building
- Provides actionable insights across multiple marketing channels
- Distinguishes between leading indicators (predictive) and lagging indicators (confirmatory)
- Enables stakeholders at all levels to make informed decisions

## Core framework approach

Integrate these complementary methodologies:
- **OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)** - To ensure measurement of what truly matters and maintain strategic focus
- **Marketing Mix Modeling** - To accurately attribute results to the appropriate channels and optimize budget allocation
- **Brand Health Tracking** - To monitor long-term brand equity and perception evolution
- **Balanced Scorecard** - To connect marketing metrics with broader business strategy across financial, customer, internal process, and learning/growth dimensions
- **Multi-Touch Attribution** - To understand the granular impact of each touchpoint in the customer journey

## After you run it

Turn this framework into your measurement operating system:
- **Implement dashboards** starting with the executive view—get leadership bought in first
- **Set up OKR tracking** in a visible place (Notion, spreadsheet, OKR tool) that the team reviews weekly
- **Configure tools** to collect the metrics you've defined (GA4 goals, CRM reports, attribution models)
- **Establish reporting rituals** - weekly team reviews, monthly leadership reviews, quarterly board prep
- **Train the team** on what metrics matter and how to interpret them
- **Start brand health tracking** even if it's manual surveys at first—trend data is gold

Build the infrastructure:
- **Connect data sources** - integrate CRM, marketing automation, analytics platforms
- **Create report templates** so reporting is consistent and efficient
- **Automate where possible** - scheduled reports, dashboard refreshes, alert triggers
- **Document definitions** - what exactly counts as an MQL? How is pipeline attributed?

Review and evolve:
- **Monthly:** Check if metrics are still answering the right questions
- **Quarterly:** Audit for blind spots—what new questions emerged that you can't answer?
- **Annually:** Comprehensive framework refresh aligned with new business goals

Mature over time:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Basic dashboards, manual reporting, foundational OKRs
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Automated reporting, multi-touch attribution, brand health baseline
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-12):** Sophisticated attribution, predictive analytics, marketing mix modeling
