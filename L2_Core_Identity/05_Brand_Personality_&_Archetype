# Brand personality & archetype

## What this generates

Your complete brand personality foundation using Carl Jung's 12 Brand Archetypes and Jennifer Aaker's Brand Personality Dimensions. You'll get archetype identification, personality dimension scores, behavioral examples, voice expressions, and strategic implications—everything you need to ensure your brand shows up consistently across every touchpoint.

## Why you need this

A defined brand personality isn't fluffy marketing theory—it's the strategic framework that helps everyone make decisions. When your designer is choosing a color palette, your copywriter is drafting an email, or your product team is building a feature, they need to know: does this feel like us? Without clear personality guidelines, you get schizophrenic brand expressions that confuse customers and dilute your positioning.

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you have:
- A gut sense of brands you admire (and why their personality resonates)
- Some clarity on how formal or casual you want to be
- Customer feedback about how your brand currently "feels" to them
- Competitive intelligence about personality gaps in your market

If you're pre-launch, that's fine. You can build this based on founder vision, target audience insights, and strategic positioning choices. Just be ready to test and refine as you get real customer interactions.

## Prepare your inputs

Fill out this form before running the prompt. The more honest and specific you are, the more differentiated your brand personality will be.

### Brand basics

**{{companyName}}**  
Your company/brand name

**{{companyDescription}}**  
In 2-3 sentences, what does your brand do? What problem do you solve?

**{{desiredFeelings}}**  
How do you want customers to feel about your brand?  
Examples: "trusted, inspired, empowered" or "confident, supported, innovative" or "safe, understood, capable"

**{{personalityTraits}}**  
List 3-5 adjectives that describe your ideal brand personality.  
Examples: bold, authentic, innovative, approachable, expert, playful, premium, rebellious, nurturing, ambitious

### Brand inspiration & direction

**{{admiredBrands}}**  
Name 3-5 brands you admire in ANY industry and briefly note why.  
Examples:  
- "Apple - minimalist and premium, never overexplains"  
- "Patagonia - values-driven without being preachy"  
- "Mailchimp - makes complex things approachable and fun"

**{{antiBrands}}**  
Name 2-3 brands or brand styles that feel wrong for your positioning and explain why.  
Examples:  
- "Too corporate like IBM - overly formal and distant"  
- "Too playful like Innocent Smoothies - we need more authority"  
- "Too luxury like Rolex - creates distance from our everyday audience"

### Communication preferences

**{{formalityLevel}}**  
On a scale of 1-5, how formal should your brand voice be?  
- 1 = very casual/conversational (startup, DTC, consumer tech)
- 2 = friendly professional (modern B2B, SaaS)
- 3 = balanced professional (traditional B2B)
- 4 = formal professional (finance, legal, healthcare)
- 5 = very formal/corporate (enterprise, government)

**{{industryNormsApproach}}**  
Should you follow industry communication norms, break them, or be selective? Explain your reasoning.  
Examples:  
- "Break them - our industry is stuck in corporate speak and we want to stand out"  
- "Follow them - trust and credibility matter more than differentiation in our space"  
- "Selective - professional when it matters, but more human than our competitors"

**{{culturalNuances}}**  
Are there specific cultural, regional, or demographic considerations that should influence your brand personality?  
Examples:  
- "B2B enterprise audience - need to balance approachable with authoritative"  
- "Gen Z consumers - need to be authentic and values-forward"  
- "Global brand with local sensitivity - avoid US-centric language"

### Audience & market context

**{{targetAudience}}**  
Who are your primary customers? Include demographics, psychographics, and key characteristics.

**{{competitiveLandscape}}**  
What industry are you in? Who are your main competitors? What's the typical brand personality in your space? (e.g., "Cybersecurity - most brands are fear-based and technical, we want to be empowering")

**Pro tip:** When identifying admired brands, look beyond your industry. Some of the best personality differentiation comes from borrowing traits from unexpected categories. A B2B SaaS company might learn from Patagonia's values-driven authenticity or Nike's motivational energy.

## After you run it

Use this framework to:
- **Audit existing content** for personality consistency
- **Brief creative agencies or freelancers** on your brand character
- **Train customer-facing teams** so they embody the personality in interactions
- **Guide design decisions** (colors, imagery, UI patterns that match the archetype)
- **Evaluate partnerships** (does this partner brand align with our personality?)
- **Screen new hires** for cultural fit with the brand personality

Test the personality with your team. If everyone's interpretation is wildly different, the framework needs more specificity. Real brand personalities should be distinctive enough that you can tell when something's on-brand vs. off-brand.

Revisit this when you rebrand, enter new markets, or get consistent feedback that your personality isn't landing as intended. Your archetype might stay stable, but the expression can evolve as your audience or market matures.
