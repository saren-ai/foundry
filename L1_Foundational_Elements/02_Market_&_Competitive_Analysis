# Market & competitive analysis

## What this generates

A complete competitive intelligence package built on Porter's Five Forces and PESTEL frameworks. You'll get battlecards, trap-setting questions, win/loss analysis, and a deal qualification framework—everything your sales and marketing teams need to compete effectively and position with confidence.

## Why you need this

You can't build differentiated messaging or train a sales team without knowing exactly where you stand in the market. This isn't academic analysis—it's battle-tested competitive intel that helps you win more deals and walk away from the ones you shouldn't chase.

## Before you start

This prompt works best when you feed it real competitive intelligence, not guesses. Gather:
- Win/loss data from recent deals
- Sales call recordings where competitors came up
- Competitive intel from your sales team
- Analyst reports or market research on your category
- Competitor websites, pricing pages, and case studies
- Customer feedback about alternatives they considered

If you're early-stage, lean on founder experience, investor conversations, and whatever you can scrape from competitor positioning and customer reviews.

## Prepare your inputs

Fill out this form before running the prompt. The more specific you are, the sharper the output.

### Company profile

**{{COMPANY_NAME}}**  
Your company name

**{{PRODUCT_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION}}**  
What you sell in 2-3 sentences—focus on the problem you solve, not feature lists

**{{TARGET_MARKET_SEGMENTS}}**  
Who buys from you? Include industries, company sizes, specific roles.

**{{COMPANY_SIZE_STAGE}}**  
Where are you? Choose one: Startup / Growth-stage / Established Enterprise

### Competitive intelligence

**{{PRIMARY_COMPETITORS}}**  
List 3-5 companies you compete with most often in deals. Include their names and a one-line description if they're not well-known.

**{{SECONDARY_COMPETITORS}}**  
Emerging or adjacent competitors on your radar. These might not be direct competitors today but could be threats tomorrow.

**{{WIN_REASONS}}**  
Why do you typically win deals? Be specific: features, service quality, pricing model, relationships, faster implementation, better support, etc. Pull from sales notes or customer interviews.

**{{LOSS_REASONS}}**  
Why do you typically lose deals? Be honest: feature gaps, pricing concerns, brand perception, implementation complexity, lack of integrations, etc.

**{{COMPARISON_CRITERIA}}**  
What dimensions do prospects use to evaluate vendors? Examples: ease of integration, security certifications, customization options, price, support response time, scalability, user experience, etc.

**{{COMPETITOR_WEAKNESSES}}**  
Known vulnerabilities in competitor offerings, positioning, or go-to-market strategy. Examples: poor customer service, outdated technology, complex pricing, limited integrations, weak mobile experience, slow innovation pace, etc.

### Market dynamics

**{{RECENT_MARKET_SHIFTS}}**  
Any significant industry changes in the last 12-18 months that impact how you compete. Think: new regulations, buyer behavior changes, economic factors, consolidation, funding environment shifts, remote work impacts, etc.

**{{EMERGING_COMPETITORS}}**  
New entrants or companies expanding into your space. Include startups that just raised funding or adjacent players moving into your category.

**{{TECHNOLOGY_TRENDS}}**  
Relevant tech developments impacting your market. Examples: AI adoption, automation trends, platform shifts, API-first architectures, no-code movement, data privacy regulations, etc.

### Strategic boundaries

**{{IDEAL_CUSTOMER_PROFILE}}**  
Who is your best-fit customer? Include company size, industry, use case, pain points, tech stack, buying process. Reference your Target Customer Profiles if you've already created them.

**{{DEALS_TO_AVOID}}**  
Red flags or deal types that historically haven't worked out. Examples: companies under 50 employees, organizations without dedicated IT teams, prospects requiring custom development, price-sensitive buyers in certain verticals, etc.

### Supporting materials (optional but helpful)

**{{EXISTING_COLLATERAL}}**  
Links to current positioning documents, website, pitch decks, or one-pagers.

**{{WIN_LOSS_DATA}}**  
Any formal win/loss analysis, Gong call summaries, or customer feedback from recent deals.

**{{SALES_TEAM_INSIGHTS}}**  
Common objections, trap questions that work, competitive situations your team faces most often, or internal competitive notes.

**Pro tip:** The win/loss reasons and competitor weaknesses are the most critical inputs. If you don't have formal data, interview your top 3 sales reps and synthesize their insights. Real quotes from customer calls make everything more actionable.

Create clear criteria for:
- **Green light deals:** High-probability wins with strong fit

Include scoring rubric with qualifying questions.

### 6. Competitive differentiator matrix

Identify:
- **Core differentiators:** High importance + strong advantage (lead with these)
- **Table stakes:** High importance + weak advantage (must maintain parity)
- **Niche advantages:** Low importance + strong advantage (use selectively)
