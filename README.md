# Saren's Marketing Foundry

The essential prompt matrix for building B2B marketing messaging infrastructure from scratch.

## What this is

Twenty-one battle-tested prompts that generate the foundational documents every B2B SaaS company needs—but most skip because they don't know where to start. Think of this as the scaffolding you need before you can build campaigns, enablement, or any go-to-market motion that is sustainable over time, and actually helps get things done.

Built for early-stage teams who need to move fast but can't afford to build on quicksand.

## What's inside

- **[21. Review & Iteration Protocol](L7_Evolution_&_Refinement/21_Review_&_Iteration)** — how you keep it fresh without starting over

## How to use this

Each prompt lives in its own file within the seven layer folders:

- **Prompt template** you can copy/paste into your AI tool of choice
- **Context** on why this document matters
- **Examples** of what good looks like

Start at Layer 1 and work through sequentially. Don't skip ahead. These build on each other.

Expect to spend 60–90 minutes per prompt if you're doing it right. Block the time, gather your team's input, and don't settle for generic outputs. The prompts are designed to pull out what makes your company different—but you have to show up with the raw material.

## Who this is for

- **Founders** who need marketing infrastructure but don't have a CMO yet
- **Early marketing hires** who inherited a blank slate
- **Consultants** helping clients build their go-to-market foundation
- **Anyone tired of winging it** with random campaigns and wondering why nothing lands

This isn't for people who want to "just start posting." You can do that on your own. This is for teams ready to build a foundation that compounds.

**Built by people who've done this hundreds of times and are tired of watching teams repeat the same mistakes.**
